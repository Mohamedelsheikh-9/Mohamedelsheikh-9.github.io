    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Bouncing Ball, Recursive, Sound</h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at 
	City (2020). This Processing project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding 
  of the use of sounds, arrays, functions , calsses, loops, randomness and many more. I have created 3 different application in one application. 
  I created a menu in that have 3 box, whenever someone chooses 
  one box it goes to the application that was coded to this specific square.
    </p>
<br>
    <p>
       The "Red box" application is a bouncing ball game. I have used a built-in function called "KeyPressed" to set some keys to produce more balls when someone clicks these keys.
        I have used "For" loop to make it produce more ball when someone chooses to press; r,g,b,m.
         If someone HOLDS "m" the program will produce more balls in different colours and slows down the speed of the game.
    </p>
<br>
<p>
  The "Yellow box" application is a recursive graphic application. In this application, i have used recursion which functions call themselves at the end of its block until there is a condition to stop it. 
  It creates random circles at random places on the screen.
</p>
<br>
<p>
  The "Green box" application is a sound effect game. In this application, i have used Sound which is a sound library that allows us to add any sound or audio to our applications.
  When someone clicks one the green box it plays a sound that i have implemented
